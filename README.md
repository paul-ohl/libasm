# Libasm

Creating a few standard functions in assembly language.

C is low level, but we can go lower!

## How to use

First, run `./configure.sh` to check if nasm is installed, if it is not
installed and you are using brew, it will be installed automatically.

Then, run `make` to compile the project, and/or `make run` to launch tests.

When you are done, run `make fclean` to remove all the temporary files.
